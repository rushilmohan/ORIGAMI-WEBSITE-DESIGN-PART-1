      </li>
      <li>
        Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other
        animals can't eat.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Their wings are transparent and can seem rainbow-hued when held up to a
        light source. The veins on the tips of the wings of some cicadas make
        the shape of a W.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cicadas can live a relatively long time: 4 to 17 years, depending on
        whether they are annual or periodical cicadas. The periodical cicadas
        live the longest.
      </li>
      <li>
        They spend most of their lives underground as larvae, followed by a
        short adulthood — from two to six weeks — above ground, according to the
        University of Michigan's Museum of Zoology.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused
        to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete
        Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a
        friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.
      </li>
      <li>
        Washable teddy bears didn't appear until 1954 when the stuffing was
        switched to an easier to clean nylon fill. Before that, they were
        stuffed with mohair, wool, and other hard to clean fills.
